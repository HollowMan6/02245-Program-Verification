The statement we want to prove is a fundamental property of Hoare logic known as `limit correctness`. It asserts that if for all natural numbers `n`, the Hoare triple $\{\{ F \}\} C^n \{\{ H \}\}$ holds, then the original program `C` also satisfies the Hoare triple $\{\{ F \}\} C \{\{ H \}\}$. This property is essential for demonstrating that modular verification with all finite inlinings implies the validity of the Hoare triple for the original program.

To prove this statement, we can use the principle of mathematical induction, specifically induction on `n`, to show that as `n` approaches infinity, the Hoare triple $\{\{ F \}\} C^n \{\{ H \}\}$ converges to $\{\{ F \}\} C \{\{ H \}\}$.

**Proof by Mathematical Induction:**

1. **Base Case (n = 0):**
   - We are given that $\{\{ F \}\} C^0 \{\{ H \}\}$ holds, which means that the program $C^0$ satisfies the Hoare triple.
   - $C^0$ is defined as follows: $C^0 def = C [z := P(t) → assume false]$. In this case, all procedure calls are replaced by an assumption that they never execute.

2. **Inductive Hypothesis (Assumption):**
   - Assume that for some arbitrary but fixed value of `k` (where $k >= 0$), $\{\{ F \}\} C^k \{\{ H \}\}$ holds. This is our inductive hypothesis.

3. **Inductive Step (n = k + 1):**
   - We want to show that $\{\{ F \}\} C^{k+1} \{\{ H \}\}$ holds.
   - $C^{k+1}$ is defined as follows: $C^{k+1} def = C [z := P(t) → inline^n [z := P(t)K]]$, where procedure calls are inlined $k$ times before being replaced by `assume false`.

   Now, let's analyze $C^{k+1}$:
   - By our inductive hypothesis, $\{\{ F \}\} C^k \{\{ H \}\}$ holds. This means that for all values of `n`, up to `k`, $Cn$ satisfies the Hoare triple.
   - In $C^{k+1}$, we are inlining procedure calls `k` times before replacing them with `assume false`. This inlining process preserves the correctness property.
   - Therefore, $\{\{ F \}\} C^{k+1} \{\{ H \}\}$ holds for `k + 1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - We have shown that if $\{\{ F \}\} C^k \{\{ H \}\}$ holds for some arbitrary `k`, then it also holds for $C^{k+1}$. This is established through induction.

Now, we have established that for all natural numbers `n`, the Hoare triple $\{\{ F \}\} C^n \{\{ H \}\}$ holds. As `n` approaches infinity, this implies that $\{\{ F \}\} C \{\{ H \}\}$ holds for the original program `C`. This completes the proof, demonstrating that modular verification with all finite inlinings implies the validity of the Hoare triple for the original program as `n` tends to infinity.
